/**
 * This class has the responsibility to create a maze of given dimensions (width, height) together with a solution based on a distance matrix.
 * The Maze class depends on it. The MazeBuilder performs its calculations within its own separate thread such that communication between 
 * Maze and MazeBuilder operates as follows. Maze calls the build() method and provides width and height. Maze has a call back method newMaze that
 * this class calls to communicate a new maze and a BSP root node and a solution.
 * 
 * The maze is built with a randomized version of Prim's algorithm. 
 * This means a spanning tree is expanded into a set of cells by removing walls from the maze.
 *
